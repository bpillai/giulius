        <h1>Guicy</h1>
        This package contains a tiny framework which sits on top of Guice and 
        allows configuration to be done using properties files.  It uses 
        Apache Commons Configuration under the hood, so configuration can
        come from wherever the implementation gets it.
        
        <h2>Why not use plain Guice</h2>
        Actually, if you're using this, you are.  The only difference is 
        that it standardizes how configuration is loaded.
        
        <h2>What it does</h2>
        Guice has a way of specifying specific instances of things to inject,
        using the &#064;Named annotation, e.g.
        <pre>
            public class MyServer {
                MyServer (@Named("port") int port, @Named("baseUrl") String url) {
                    ...
                }
            }
        </pre>
        Needless to say, when we get to the level of what port to open and
        what base URL to use, we are at the point of things which should not
        be hard-coded into Java code.
        <p/>
        The good thing about Guice is that wherever it is straightforward to
        do something with simple Java code, you can.  By being
        laser-focused on the dependency injection issue, it leaves open the
        question of configuration - which definitely needs to come from
        somewhere.  This library is one solution to that problem.
        <p/>
        You initialize Guice in the usual way, by passing it a bunch of
        Guice <code>Module</code>s which bind the interfaces which you code
        to to implementations of those interfaces.  The main difference is that
        you will do it by instantiating an instance of <code>Dependencies</code>
        and letting it take care of actual Guice initialization:
        <pre>
Dependencies deps = new Dependencies (new ModuleA(), new ModuleB());
Server server = deps.getInstance(Server.class);
server.start();
        </pre>
        <p/>
        Default configuration is done using the ClasspathConfiguration to
        create an Apache Commons Configuration object.  Values from that are
        used to populate Java primitives which Guice should inject that use
        the &#064;Named annotation.
        
        <h3>Shutdown Hooks</h3>
        ShutdownHookRegistry allows you to register runnables to be run on
        orderly VM shutdown, or whenever <code>Dependencies.shutdown()</code> 
        is called (for example, when a servlet is unloaded or after a test
        is complete).  Use this to close connections and files and such.
        
        <h3>Scopes</h3>
        One of the more powerful features of Guice is scopes.  A scope is 
        really a binding for a bunch of ThreadLocals, which Guice can use to
        look up and inject objects of particular types.
        <p/>
        This library includes base classes for single-entry and reentrant scopes,
        and for wrapping ExecutorService thread pools such that the context
        something was submitted in is reconstructed before it is run.  This
        can serve as the basis for additional frameworks on top of Guice, such
        as Propeller.
